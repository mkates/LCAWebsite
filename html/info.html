			<h1> Information for Parents </h1>
			<img src="http://www.mit-lca.org/uploads/images/0013/3073/beaver.jpg"/>
			<p> Is your son considering joining Lambda Chi Alpha at MIT? Are you a parent of one of the members of our chapter? Either way, welcome! Parents are an important part of our Lambda Chi family.</p>
			<p> There are many stereotypes about fraternal organizations in the media. So, we can understand why parents may be initially concerned about their son's membership in a fraternity. Many of our parents had concerns in the beginning as well.</p>
			<p> Lambda Chi offers a strong support system for your son. Academics are our primary concern, as we balance sports, leadership positions and social events for a well-rounded college experience. After college, the support system remains, as our members benefit from career connections and lifelong friendship with our alumni.</p>
			<p> Our members and alumni advisors are happy to speak with you about any of your questions or concerns. Please feel free to contact Program Advisor Steve Pettinato at any time: 773-562-0142, spett@rcn.com. </p>
			<p> We encourage parents to visit our home away from home at 99 Bay State Road in Boston's historic Back Bay. In fact, we are planning a parents' brunch or dinner later in the year. We look forward to meeting you and introducing you to our brotherhood.</p>

			<h1> A Parent's Testimonial </h1>
			<img src="../img/yurk_family.jpg"/>
			<p>"The fraternity experience for our son Kevin has been critical to his success at MIT. Most importantly he found the friends that every kid needs for support, guidance and to have fun during their college experience. This includes help with academic issues and extracurricular activities as well as getting around the Boston community. In addition Kevin has developed his leadership skills and become more independent. His big brother Mike was there when he needed him and Kevin has been there for his little brother Terrence. The fraternity has extended Kevin's friendships to students and alumni of MIT of all ages which will help him in the years to come." </p>

			<h1> Position Against Hazing </h1>
			<p> Our Lambda Chi chapter believes that hazing has no place in brotherhood. The values of our fraternity reflect the following statement from Lambda Chi Alpha International: Lambda Chi Alpha was the first fraternity to eliminate pledging and remains a leader in the fight against hazing, alcohol abuse, and other challenges facing today's college student. Lambda Chi Alpha serves to complement higher education by providing opportunities for academic achievement, leadership development, and lifelong friendships.</p>
